1. Declare an integer array of size 6, initialize it with user input, calculate and print the average.
Now calculate the percentage of numbers that are above that average.
For example: if 3 of the array elements are greater than average, percentage is: 3 * 100 / 6 = 50%


2. Take an integer from user, generate that many fibonacci numbers and store in an array.
Display the array.
Sample output:
Enter a number: 8
First 8 Fibonacci numbers: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13


3. Take a 3X3 array and initialize it with these values:
3 4 9
2 9 11
4 6 0
Calculate and print the sum for each row, column and both diagonals.


4. Take an integer array and print only the numbers that are in consecutive orders of 3.
Enter size: 12
Enter numbers: 1 2 3 2 2 2 11 4 4 4 3 3
Output: 2 4
